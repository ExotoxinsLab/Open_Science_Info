-------------------------

What are their contact details and their roles in the project?

Funding organization
--------------------

If funding is granted, what is the reference number of the funding
granted?\

involved, which organisation owns what data?

Roles
-----

Who is responsible for updating the DMP and making sure that it's
followed? Do project participants have any specific roles? What is the
project time line?

Cost and resources
------------------

Are there costs you need to consider to buy specific software or
hardware? Are there costs you need to consider for storage and backup?
Are potential expenses and resources for (preparing the data for)
archiving covered? What resources will be dedicated to data management
ensuring that data will be FAIR?

Data description and collection or re-use of existing data
==========================================================

What kind of data will be used during the project? If you are reusing
existing data: What is the scope, volume and format? How are different
data sources integrated? If you are collecting new data can you clarify
why this is necessary?

Origin of the data
------------------

Types of data created
---------------------

Types of data re-used
---------------------

Organizing and Documenting the data
===================================

Data collection
---------------

How will the data be collected? Is specific software or hardware or
staff required? Who will be responsible for the data collection? During
which period will the data be collected? Where will the data be
collected?

Data organization
-----------------

How will you organise your data? Will the data be organised in simple
files or more complex databases? How will the data quality during the
project be ensured? If data consists of many different file types (e.g.
videos, text, photos), is it possible to structure the data in a logical
way?

Data type and size
------------------

What type(s) of data will be collected? What is the scope, quantity and
format of the material? After the project: What is the total amount of
data collected (in MB/GB)?

Data format
-----------

In what format will your data be? Does the format change from the
original to the processed/final data? Will your (final) data be
available in an open format?

Directory structure and names
-----------------------------

How will you structure and name your folders/directories?

File structure and names
------------------------

How will you structure and name your folders?

Documentation
-------------

What documentation will be created during the different phases of the
project? How will the documentation be structured?

Metadata
--------

What metadata will be provided with the collected/ generated/ reused
data? How will metadata for each object be created? Is there any program
that can be used to document the data? Can metadata be added directly
into the files or will the metadata be produced in another program or
document?

Metadata standard (if applicable)
---------------------------------

What metadata standard(s) will you use?

Processing your data
====================

Versioning
----------

What is your strategy concerning versioning your data files (and
scripts) during the project? Will you create and/or follow a convention
for versioning your data? Who will be responsible for securing that a
"Masterfile" will be maintained, documented and versioned according to
the project guidelines? How can different versions of a data file be
distinguished?

Interoperability
----------------

Will you make use of established software and hardware? If not, how does
the software and hardware you use relate to other research?

If applicable: Will you make use of established terminologies/ontologies
(i.e. structured controlled vocabularies) in the project? If not, how do
your terminologies relate to established ones? Which coding is used (if
any)? Will you build on established coding schemes? If not, how does
your coding relate to other research?

Data quality
------------

How will data quality be evaluated? What data quality control measures
will be used?

Storing data and metadata
=========================

Storage
-------

How and where will the (meta)data be stored during the project? For how
long will the (meta)data be stored?

Backup
------

How, where and at what intervals will the (meta)data be backed-up? How
will data be recovered in the case of a (meta)data loss incident?

Security
--------

How will sensitive (meta)data be protected? (if applicable) How will
(meta)data access be managed?

Protecting your data
====================

Ethical Review (if applicable)
------------------------------

Does your project require approval by a local ethics committee? How will
possible ethical issues be taken into account, and codes of conduct
followed?

Informed consent (if applicable)
--------------------------------

Do you require informed consent for your project? If so, how will
permission be obtained? How are consent files organised and stored?

(sensitive) Personal data /confidential information (if applicable)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

How will access to (sensitive) personal data during the project be
controlled? How will collaborators be granted access to the data in a
secure way? If the research project is going to have data that includes
confidential information or information that requires informed consent,
is there a requirement to notify a privacy officer? Is there any
confidential information within the material that requires special
treatment and/or limits the access to it during/after the project? How
will the material be protected during/after the project? How will
permissions and restrictions be enforced?

Intellectual property rights (IPR) or Copyrights
------------------------------------------------

Are there IPR or copyright issues to consider? Will permission be needed
to collect/reuse the data? Will these rights be transferred to another
organisation for data distribution and archiving?

Agreements (if applicable)
--------------------------

What are the agreements with other stakeholders?

Restrictions (if applicable)
----------------------------

Are there any other restrictions that need to be considered?

Archiving and publishing your data
==================================

Archiving
---------

How and where will the data be stored after the project's completion?
Will you archive your data in a trusted data repository? Will the
application of a persistent identifier to your data be ensured?

Data formats
------------

What formats will you provide your data in for archiving (and sharing)?
Will specific software be required to process your data? Can this
software be deposited with the data?

Access (if applicable)
----------------------

Will your data be available (Open Access)? Will all data or only parts
of it be published? What licenses do you need for your data? How should
your data be cited when reused? Will there be an embargo period for (all
or some of) the data? Are there other agreements or restrictions (see
above) that need to be considered? Are there any legal/ethical
restrictions that prevents the publication of all the material? Will
these restrictions mean that action must be taken before the material
can be made available? Is there a risk of delayed publication/making
data available (all or parts of)? If so what might be needed to do to
avoid this?

Discovering data
================

Identification of needs
-----------------------

Do you plan to use existing data for your research? What is the purpose
for which you need the data? What do you want to learn from the data?
What type of data do you need?

Search for data
---------------

Do you know where the data may be located? How do you plan to search for
the data? Evaluation of data quality What is the minimal required
quality of the data (in terms of origin, contents, scope, size, methods,
etc.)? How do you plan to evaluate data quality (evaluation of metadata,
tests, analysis, comparisons)?

Gaining access to data
----------------------

What are the (expected) terms and conditions for data access and use?
What is the (expected) process for gaining access to the data? What is
the (expected) time-span of the process for gaining access to the data?
What are the (expected) costs for data access and use?
